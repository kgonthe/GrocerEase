Kgonthe Radebe Written Reflection

Looking back at my journey through the web development course this semester, it must be said that it has been quite a ride. The time during my first core semester spent learning about web development basics has been an extremely eye-opening educational experience so far. Not only because this has been my first time interacting with this subject in such great detail, but also because I learned so much that I can take beyond the classroom.

Initially, I embarked on this study path with a little bit of apprehension, unsure of what laid before me. But with each milestone, I found myself delving deeper into the world of coding and design.

One of the most challenging aspects of the module was dealing with the sheer amount of new information and skills to practise. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript and backend development, the number of unfamiliar concepts was daunting. There were moments when I felt like I was drowning and couldn’t get myself out of it, just barely able to tread water. However, with painstaking persistence, I slowly began to piece together the ‘puzzle’, one line of code at a time.

Another obstacle I faced was reaching out for help (or, rather, not) when I needed it. Admitting that I was struggling and asking for assistance still does not come easy to me. I fear appearing inept or burdensome to others. So, I try to get by with the “I’ll figure it out” mindset. This is something I’ve been working on since my orientation semester and will probably continue to do
 
 so well into the rest of my collegiate career. Yet, as I soon discovered, asking for help is not a sign of weakness but rather a testament to my willingness to learn and grow as a developer. With the support of my peers and tutors, I learned to overcome this and, in true CODE spirit, embrace collaboration. Essentially realising that we are all in this together.
Despite the challenges, the teaching and learning resources provided were extremely useful. From online tools to the in-person sessions, there was no shortage of support available. Whenever I found myself stuck with a particularly tricky problem, I knew I could count on my classmates to lend a helping hand.

Upon reflection, I realise how much I've grown professionally throughout and because of this module. I've not only honed my technical skills but also developed my vital interpersonal abilities, such as effective communication and collaboration. I know that I will carry these lessons and memories far beyond just web development in my personal and professional lives.
